# python-challenge_2.0

This project consisted of analyzing two seperate datasets.  

With the first dataset budget_data.csv we were tasked to find the following  
1) The total number of months included in the dataset  
2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
3) The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
5) The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period  

and then export this data analysis to a text file.

This was accomplished with for loops and conditional if statements to create running profit/loss tallies

The second part was similar, but using election_data.csv to analyze..  
1) The total number of votes cast  
2) A complete list of candidates who received votes  
3) The percentage of votes each candidate won  
4) The total number of votes each candidate won  
5) The winner of the election based on popular vote.  

and also export this to a text file.

This was created mostly using for loops and empty dictionaries to store candidate vote tallies
